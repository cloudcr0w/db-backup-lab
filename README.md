# Database Backup Lab (WIP)

This project explores backup and restore strategies for PostgreSQL and MySQL databases, both in local and cloud-hosted environments (e.g., AWS RDS). It simulates simple disaster recovery workflows using native tools like `pg_dump` and `mysqldump`.

## Goals
- Automate scheduled backups using Bash scripting
- Test backup integrity and simulate restore procedures
- Document real-world scenarios for RDS and local databases
- Explore monitoring and alerting around backup processes

## Tools
- PostgreSQL, MySQL
- pg_dump, mysqldump
- Bash
- AWS RDS (optional)
